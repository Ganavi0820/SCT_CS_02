Image Encryption Tool Using Pixel Manipulation
🔐 Project Overview
This project is a simple image encryption and decryption tool built using Python.
It uses pixel manipulation techniques such as:

Swapping pixel values
Applying mathematical operations on pixels (XOR, addition, subtraction)
This process scrambles the image during encryption and restores it during decryption.

📌 Features
Encrypt images using:
XOR encryption
RGB value shifting
Pixel swapping
visual studio code
Decrypt the encrypted image back to original
Beginner-friendly Python code
Uses Pillow (PIL) library
🛠 Requirements
Install required library:

pip install pill
