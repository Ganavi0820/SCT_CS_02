# 🔐 Image Encryption and Decryption using XOR & Random Noise

This project performs **image encryption and decryption** using a simple XOR operation combined with **pseudo-random noise** generated from a numeric key.  
The same key must be used for both encryption and decryption.

---

## ⭐ Features
- Encrypts any image using XOR-based random noise.
- Decrypts the encrypted image back to the original using the same key.
- Simple and beginner-friendly code.
- Uses **NumPy** and **Pillow (PIL)**.

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy
